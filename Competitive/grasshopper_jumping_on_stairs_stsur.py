Imagine there is a stair case with  first step starting from 1.
A grashopper in the stairs can jump any number of steps up or down from any step. If the number of steps to jump
is given in an array where negative numbers are for jumping downstairs, find the minimum step it has to be in so that
it doesnt go below step 1. (out of the stair case).

Ex : steps = [1, -4, -2, 3]
    ans: 6 ==> 6 +1 -4 -2 = 1 , Any starting point below 6 will result in value <= 0
